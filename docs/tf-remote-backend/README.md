# Terraform Remote State Backend using S3 and DynamoDB

Terraformâ€™s **remote backend**â€”particularly using an S3 bucket with a DynamoDB lock tableâ€”addresses two critical problems:

---

### 1. Centralized **Shared tfstate**

Instead of saving the `terraform.tfstate` file locally (which leads to silos and outdated state), Terraform uses an S3 bucket to store state centrally. This means:

* Every collaborator (or CI/CD system) automatically retrieves and writes the same live state.
* Enables state versioning via S3 bucket versioning for recovery and auditability.

---

### 2. **Concurrency & State Conflicts**

Terraform operations typically readâ€‘modifyâ€‘write the same state. Without locking, parallel executions (e.g., by different team members or pipelines) can corrupt the state or overwrite each otherâ€™s work.

* **DynamoDB table with a `LockID` hash key** acts as a coordination mechanism.
* Before modifying state, Terraform writes a lock record into DynamoDB; if itâ€™s in use, concurrent runs will wait/fail instead of clobbering the file.
* Upon completion, Terraform releases the lock by deleting that record.

Sample lock snippet:

```json
{
  "ID": "7c01d8ac-2e4c-0949-42d2-58da864cf82a", // LockID
  "Operation": "OperationTypeApply",
  "Info": "",
  "Who": "deepakpant@Deepaks-MacBook-Air.local",
  "Version": "1.12.2",
  "Created": "2025-07-15T10:14:06.962194Z",
  "Path": "tf-remote-backend-bucket-â€¦/terraform.tfstate"
}
```

* **`ID`** = LockID
* **`Operation`**, **`Who`**, **`Version`**, **`Created`**, and **`Path`** provide metadata about who has locked the file and why.

### ðŸ”’ How S3 + DynamoDB work together

1. **Backend config (in Terraform):**

   ```hcl
   terraform {
     backend "s3" {
       bucket         = "my-tf-state-bucket"
       key            = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
       region         = "us-east-1"
       dynamodb_table = "terraform-state-locks"
       encrypt        = true
     }
   }
   ```

2. **During `terraform init`**, it connects to S3 and DynamoDB:

   * Looks for existing state in S3.
   * When you run `terraform plan` or `apply`, it first attempts to insert a lock entry in DynamoDB.

3. **Work happens with lock in place**:

   * Terraform downloads the `terraform.tfstate` file from S3.
   * Plans and applies changes.

4. **Upon completion**:

   * Updated state is written back to the S3 bucket.
   * The DynamoDB lock entry is deleted.

5. **If someone else attempts a simultaneous run**:
   Terraform wonâ€™t proceed until the lock is releasedâ€”thus preventing conflicts.

### âœ… Summary Table

| Component          | Role                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S3 Bucket**      | Stores `terraform.tfstate`, ensures centralized state with versioning, encryption, recovery |
| **DynamoDB**       | Provides locking using `LockID` to prevent race conditions                                  |
| **LockInfo entry** | Contains metadataâ€”who, when, what operation, state path                                     |
| **State release**  | On apply completion, updated state is saved and lock removed                                |
